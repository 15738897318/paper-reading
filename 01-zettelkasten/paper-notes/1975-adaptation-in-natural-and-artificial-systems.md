# Adaptation in natural and artificial systems

## Abstract

Name of founding work in the area. Adaptation is key to survival and evolution. Evolution implicitly optimizes organisims. AI wants to mimic biological optimization { Survival of the ttest { Exploration and exploitation { Niche nding { Robust across changing environments (Mammals v. Dinos) { Self-regulation,-repair and-reproduction 2 Artiicial Inteligence Some deenitions { "Making computers do what they do in the movies" { "Making computers do what humans (currently) do best" { "Giving computers common sense; letting them make simple deci-sions" (do as I want, not what I say) { "Anything too new to be pidgeonholed" Adaptation and modiication is root of intelligence Some (Non-GA) branches of AI: { Expert Systems (Rule based deduction)
