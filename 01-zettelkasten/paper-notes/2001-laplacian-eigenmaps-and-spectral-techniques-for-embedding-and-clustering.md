# Laplacian Eigenmaps and Spectral Techniques for Embedding and Clustering

## Abstract

Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for constructing a representation for data sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Several applications are considered.
