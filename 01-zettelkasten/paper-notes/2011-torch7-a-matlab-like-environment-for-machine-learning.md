# Torch7 - A Matlab-like Environment for Machine Learning

## Abstract

Torch7 is a versatile numeric computing framework and machine learning library that extends Lua. Its goal is to provide a flexible environment to design and train learning machines. Flexibility is obtained via Lua, an extremely lightweight scripting language. High performance is obtained via efficient OpenMP/SSE and CUDA implementations of low-level numeric routines. Torch7 can easily be interfaced to third-party software thanks to Luaâ€™s light interface.
