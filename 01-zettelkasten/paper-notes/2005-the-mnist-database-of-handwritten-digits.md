# The mnist database of handwritten digits

## Abstract

Disclosed is an improved articulated bar flail having shearing edges for efficiently shredding materials. An improved shredder cylinder is disclosed with a plurality of these flails circumferentially spaced and pivotally attached to the periphery of a rotatable shaft. Also disclosed is an improved shredder apparatus which has a pair of these shredder cylinders mounted to rotate about spaced parallel axes which cooperates with a conveyer apparatus which has a pair of inclined converging conveyer belts with one of the belts mounted to move with respect to the other belt to allow the transport of articles of various sizes therethrough.
