# CMSIS-NN - Efficient Neural Network Kernels for Arm Cortex-M CPUs

## Abstract

Deep Neural Networks are becoming increasingly popular in always-on IoT edge devices performing data analytics right at the source, reducing latency as well as energy consumption for data communication. This paper presents CMSIS-NN, efficient kernels developed to maximize the performance and minimize the memory footprint of neural network (NN) applications on Arm Cortex-M processors targeted for intelligent IoT edge devices. Neural network inference based on CMSIS-NN kernels achieves 4.6X improvement in runtime/throughput and 4.9X improvement in energy efficiency.
