# Shape matching and object recognition using shape contexts

## Abstract

This paper presents my work on computing shape models that are computationally fast and invariant basic transformations like translation, scaling and rotation. In this paper, I propose shape detection using a feature called shape context. Shape context describes all boundary points of a shape with respect to any single boundary point. Thus it is descriptive of the shape of the object. Object recognition can be achieved by matching this feature with a priori knowledge of the shape context of the boundary points of the object. Experimental results are promising on handwritten digits, trademark images.
