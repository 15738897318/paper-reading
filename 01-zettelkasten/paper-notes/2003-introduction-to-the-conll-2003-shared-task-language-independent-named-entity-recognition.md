# Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task - Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition

## Abstract

We describe the CoNLL-2003 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition. We give background information on the data sets (English and German) and the evaluation method, present a general overview of the systems that have taken part in the task and discuss their performance.
