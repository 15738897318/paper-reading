# Numerical Optimization

## Abstract

no exception. MRP II and JIT=TQC in purchasing and supplier education are covered in Chapter 15. Without proper education MRP II and JIT=TQC will not be successful and will not generate their true bene®ts. Suppliers are key to the success of MRP II and JIT=TQC. They therefore need to understand these disciplines. Purchasing in the 21st century is going to be marked by continuous changes, by who can gain the competitive edge ®rst, who will be the most ̄exible and who will build the best supplier relationships. This will only be achieved by following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark, ignite change'! Only then can it happen! If you really want to know something about purchasing then this is the book to read. It is most de®nitely relevant and more importantly up to date. It will certainly be a handy reference book for a course on purchasing.
